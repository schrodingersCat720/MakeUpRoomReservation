Config Adjustments
Database credentials: check connect.php. If your groupmateâ€™s MySQL root password differs (e.g., blank vs. root), update it.

Paths: if you used absolute paths anywhere (like C:/xampp/htdocs/...), replace them with relative paths.

Permissions: make sure the reservation_slips folder is writable so PDFs can be saved.

Test Before Presentation
Start Apache + MySQL.
Visit http://localhost/reservation_system/main.php.
Try a test reservation â†’ confirm:
Room exclusion works.
PDF slip generates.
Transaction log records.

PHP extensions enabled in XAMPPâ€™s php.ini:
mbstring
gd
openssl
dom (These are usually bundled with XAMPP, but doubleâ€‘check theyâ€™re not commented out with ; in php.ini.)

Easiest path for tomorrow
Since you want zero surprises during the presentation:

Copy your entire project folder, including the vendor directory, to your groupmateâ€™s htdocs. â†’ This way, you donâ€™t need to run Composer again.

Check php.ini in XAMPP and make sure the extensions above are enabled.
Test PDF generation by making a dummy reservation â€” if the slip downloads, youâ€™re good.

ðŸ§° Backup plan
If for some reason the vendor folder didnâ€™t copy properly:
Install Composer on your groupmateâ€™s laptop.
Run composer require dompdf/dompdf inside your project folder.
Restart Apache, and youâ€™re set.
